<h1 align="center">✅ TODO</h1> 

Near-term, concrete items. See `ROADMAP.md` for the bigger picture.

## upac-cli

- `user/upac-cli/data/` (`.desktop`, `upac-mime.xml`, `.policy`) reference `Icon=upac`/`icon_name=upac`,
  but there's no actual icon asset (SVG/PNG) yet, and no install step wiring it into
  `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/...`. Needs real artwork before packaging.

## setup-cli

- It is necessary to audit the stages, break down the cycles within them into orchestrator cycles, and increase granularity across all libraries.
- Add a domain-based error system to the setup library.
